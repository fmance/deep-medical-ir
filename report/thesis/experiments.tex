\chapter{Experiments}

In this chapter, we present the application of the theory from the previous section. Concretely, we apply the system on Trec 2014 and 2015
clinical decision support track. 
The CDS track consists of medical question, describing symptoms and other relevant information. The question is to diagnose/test/treat
the patient.
The input consists of 30 queries from 2014 and 2015 each. Each query contains description and summary. Also type.
We have approximately 733K documents to search from.

Example query:

We also have ground truths, i.e. labels for around x percent of the query-doc pairs, based on trec 14,15. 

We first one to apply the baseline IR system on the queries, then use the classifier and fusion as described in the prev. section.
This is applied for both 2014, 2015.

The following params were used...
